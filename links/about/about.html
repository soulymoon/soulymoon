            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>Hey! I'm Aizhan. Currently I am pursuing my MA degree at Interface Cultures. A wonderful place where I study Media Arts in intersection with science and technologies. At first year of the course I have experimented with creative coding tools <a href="/links/creative.html"><u> *(where you can check them here:)</u></a>, like p5.js, Processing and later I have encountered Cables.gl, and VVVV.
              Later, I have experimented with <a href ="./links/Steppes/steppes.html">AI tools for generating images </a>. It was interesting to use AI, and seeing how it can make its own speculation, in my case, I have generated models of wearables and clothes for dry territories like steppes. It was incredibly cool discovering this event for AI Fashion field. Right now, i am making 3D models of those wearables to create a virtual fashion show. 
              Right now, as part of my theis i am researching on human and computer languages.
